This lecture series is conducted by `Mrs. Dharani Abeysinghe` for the Concurrent Programming Module and coding implementations were done by `Manith Jayaba`.

Concurrent programming is a technique in which two or more processes start, run in an interleaved fashion through context switching, and complete in an overlapping time period by managing access to shared resources, such as on a single core of a CPU. This does not necessarily mean that multiple processes will be running at the same instant, but rather that their execution overlaps in time. Concurrent programming is used to model processes in the outside world that happen concurrently, such as multiple clients accessing a server at the same time. It is a form of modular programming where an overall computation is factored into subcomputations that may be executed concurrently.

## Setup ⚙️

- Install `Jetbrains Toolbox` by proceeding to this [link](https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/).
- Open the app and login to your Jetbrains account (Students and Educators can get premium free of charge [click here](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students) )
- Download `CLion` IDE from the app.
- Clone the project to your system directory by entering `git clone https://github.com/Manithj/Concurrent_Programming.git` to the commandline/terminal.
- Open the project using `CLion`.
- Edit the `CMakeLists.txt` file by adding the .cpp file you need to run by `add_executable(<Project Name> <Program Name>)`.
- Have fun!!! and don’t forget to contribute ❤️ .
